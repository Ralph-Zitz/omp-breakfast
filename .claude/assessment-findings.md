# Assessment Findings

Last assessed: 2025-07-17

This file is **generated and maintained by the project assessment process** defined in `CLAUDE.md` § "Project Assessment". Each time `assess the project` is run, findings of all severities (critical, important, minor, and informational) are written here. The `/resume-assessment` command reads this file in future sessions to continue work.

**Do not edit manually** unless you are checking off a completed item. The assessment process will move completed items to `.claude/resolved-findings.md`, update open items (file/line references may shift), remove items no longer surfaced, and append new findings.

## How to use

- Run `/resume-assessment` in a new session to pick up where you left off
- Or say: "Read `.claude/assessment-findings.md` and help me work through the remaining open items."
- Check off items as they are completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`

## Critical Items

### Dependencies — `jsonwebtoken` Pulls Vulnerable and Unnecessary Crypto Crates

- [ ] **#132 — `rust_crypto` feature enables ~15 unused crates including vulnerable `rsa` (RUSTSEC-2023-0071); granular `["hmac", "sha2"]` features are available**
  - File: `Cargo.toml` (jsonwebtoken dependency)
  - Problem: `features = ["rust_crypto"]` pulls `rsa`, `ed25519-dalek`, `p256`, `p384`, `rand` — none of which are used (only HS256). The `rsa` crate has an unfixable timing side-channel advisory. `jsonwebtoken` 10.3.0 supports individual feature selection.
  - Fix: Change `features = ["rust_crypto"]` to `features = ["hmac", "sha2"]`. This eliminates the advisory and removes ~15 crates from the dependency tree.
  - Source commands: `dependency-check`

## Important Items

### Security — Argon2 Parameters Rely on Crate Defaults

- [ ] **#143 — A dependency update could silently weaken hashing parameters**
  - Files: `src/db/users.rs`, `src/middleware/auth.rs`
  - Problem: `Argon2::default()` is used for hashing and verification. While current defaults match OWASP recommendations, they could change.
  - Fix: Explicitly construct `Argon2::new(Algorithm::Argon2id, Version::V0x13, params)` in a shared constant.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`

### Security — No Production Panic for Default DB Credentials

- [ ] **#145 — Default Postgres credentials `actix/actix` used with no startup validation (unlike server/JWT secrets)**
  - Files: `config/default.yml`, `src/server.rs`
  - Problem: A misconfigured production deploy would silently use development credentials.
  - Fix: Add production-panic for default DB credentials similar to the existing secret checks.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`

## Minor Items

### Code Quality — Dead S3 Config Fields

- [ ] **#59 — `s3_key_id` and `s3_key_secret` are loaded and stored but never used**
  - Files: `src/models.rs` lines 46–47 (`State` struct), `src/config.rs` lines 13–14 (`ServerConfig` struct), `src/server.rs` lines 340–341 (state construction), `config/default.yml` lines 6–7, `config/development.yml` lines 5–6, `config/production.yml` lines 6–7
  - Problem: The `s3_key_id` and `s3_key_secret` fields are defined in `ServerConfig`, loaded from config files, stored in `State`, and propagated through all test helpers (`routes.rs`, `server.rs`, `middleware/auth.rs`), but no handler, middleware, or DB function ever reads them.
  - Fix: Either remove the fields entirely from `ServerConfig`, `State`, all config files, and all test helpers — or, if S3 integration is planned, document the intent in CLAUDE.md's Unfinished Work section.
  - Source commands: `review`, `practices-audit`

### Code Quality — Dead `database.url` Config Field

- [ ] **#68 — `database.url` field in `Settings` is configured but unused**
  - Files: `src/config.rs` lines 19–22 (`Database` struct with `#[allow(dead_code)]`), `config/default.yml` lines 10–11, `config/development.yml` lines 1–2
  - Problem: The `Database` struct contains a single `url` field marked `#[allow(dead_code)]`. The DB pool is created from the `pg.*` config fields, not from `database.url`.
  - Fix: Remove the `Database` struct and its `database` field from `Settings`. Remove `database:` sections from config files. Update the config test.
  - Source commands: `review`, `practices-audit`

### Security — Seed Data Uses Hardcoded Argon2 Salt

- [ ] **#70 — All seed users share the same Argon2 hash with a hardcoded salt**
  - File: `database_seed.sql` lines 41–57
  - Problem: All 5 seed users have identical Argon2id password hashes using the salt `dGVzdHNhbHQxMjM0NTY`. While dev-only, this creates risk if accidentally run against production.
  - Fix: Add a prominent `-- WARNING: DO NOT RUN IN PRODUCTION` comment at the top of `database_seed.sql`.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`, `db-review`

### Frontend — All Components in Single `app.rs` File

- [ ] **#71 — Frontend `app.rs` is a 600+ line monolith**
  - File: `frontend/src/app.rs`
  - Problem: The entire frontend lives in a single file. As planned pages are built, this will become unmanageable.
  - Fix: Split into module structure when building the next frontend page.
  - Source commands: `review`, `practices-audit`

### Security — No Account Lockout After Failed Auth Attempts

- [ ] **#73 — Failed authentication is rate-limited but no lockout policy exists**
  - Files: `src/routes.rs` lines 19–23, `src/handlers/users.rs`
  - Problem: The `/auth` endpoint has rate limiting but no account-level lockout after N consecutive failures.
  - Fix: Track failed login attempts per email. Lock after threshold (e.g., 5 failures in 15 minutes).
  - Source commands: `security-audit`

### Deployment — Production Config Has Placeholder Hostname

- [ ] **#75 — `config/production.yml` uses `pick.a.proper.hostname` as the PG host**
  - File: `config/production.yml` line 2
  - Problem: Placeholder string with no startup validation catch.
  - Fix: Add a startup check similar to the secret-validation panic.
  - Source commands: `practices-audit`, `review`

### Security — Swagger UI Exposed in Production

- [ ] **#112 — `/explorer` registered unconditionally regardless of environment**
  - File: `src/routes.rs` line 29
  - Problem: In production, this exposes the complete API schema, aiding attacker reconnaissance.
  - Fix: Conditionally register the Swagger UI scope only when `ENV != production`, or gate behind admin auth.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`

### Performance — Auth Cache Eviction Is O(n log n)

- [ ] **#113 — Cache eviction sorts all entries on every miss at capacity**
  - File: `src/middleware/auth.rs` lines 323–335
  - Problem: When the cache is full (1000 entries), every miss collects all entries into a `Vec`, sorts by timestamp, and removes the oldest 10%. This is O(n log n) per miss.
  - Fix: Use a proper LRU data structure (e.g., `lru` crate) or a min-heap.
  - Source commands: `review`

### Documentation — Frontend Test Category Breakdown Sums to 21, Not 23

- [ ] **#163 — CLAUDE.md test category breakdown omits 2 token refresh tests**
  - File: `CLAUDE.md` (Testing → Frontend → Test categories)
  - Problem: 8 categories total 4+3+3+3+2+1+2+3 = 21, but 23 WASM tests exist. Missing: `test_authed_get_retries_after_401_with_token_refresh` and `test_authed_get_double_failure_falls_back_to_login`.
  - Fix: Add "Token refresh (2 tests)" category to the breakdown.
  - Source commands: `cross-ref-check`

### Documentation — `test-gaps.md` References `gloo_timers` Which Project Doesn't Use

- [ ] **#164 — Command recommends `gloo_timers::future::sleep` but project uses custom `flush()` helper**
  - File: `.claude/commands/test-gaps.md`
  - Problem: Misleading test instruction. The project uses a Promise-based setTimeout wrapper, not `gloo-timers`.
  - Fix: Replace with instruction to use the `flush(ms)` helper.
  - Source commands: `cross-ref-check`

### Documentation — Integration Test Doc Comments Reference Deprecated `database.sql`

- [ ] **#165 — Both `api_tests.rs` and `db_tests.rs` reference `database.sql` for setup**
  - Files: `tests/api_tests.rs`, `tests/db_tests.rs` (line 3 doc comments)
  - Problem: DB is now initialized via Refinery migrations + `database_seed.sql`.
  - Fix: Update doc comments to reference migrations and `database_seed.sql`.
  - Source commands: `cross-ref-check`

### Documentation — `middleware/mod.rs` Missing from CLAUDE.md Structure Tree

- [ ] **#166 — Tree lists `auth.rs` and `openapi.rs` under `middleware/` but omits `mod.rs`**
  - File: `CLAUDE.md` (Project Structure section)
  - Problem: Inconsistent with `db/mod.rs` and `handlers/mod.rs` which are listed.
  - Fix: Add `mod.rs — Module declarations` under `middleware/`.
  - Source commands: `cross-ref-check`

### Code Quality — Missing `#[must_use]` on Auth Functions

- [ ] **#167 — `generate_token_pair`, `verify_jwt`, `invalidate_cache` return values that should not be ignored**
  - File: `src/middleware/auth.rs`
  - Fix: Add `#[must_use]` to these functions.
  - Source commands: `review`

### Dependencies — Redundant `features = ["default"]` on Crates

- [ ] **#168 — `argon2` and `opentelemetry` specify `features = ["default"]` which is a no-op**
  - File: `Cargo.toml`
  - Fix: Simplify to plain version strings.
  - Source commands: `dependency-check`

### Dependencies — Unnecessary Braces on Simple Dependencies

- [ ] **#169 — `actix-web-httpauth`, `tracing-log`, `rustls-pki-types` use `{ version = "..." }` with no other keys**
  - File: `Cargo.toml`
  - Fix: Simplify to plain version strings.
  - Source commands: `dependency-check`

### Security — Missing `X-Frame-Options` Header

- [ ] **#170 — CSP `frame-ancestors 'none'` covers modern browsers but `X-Frame-Options: DENY` is missing for older browsers**
  - File: `src/server.rs` (DefaultHeaders)
  - Fix: Add `.add(("X-Frame-Options", "DENY"))`.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`

### Testing — `AddMemberEntry` and `UpdateMemberRoleEntry` Lack `Validate` Derive

- [ ] **#171 — These models are deserialized from request bodies but `validate()` is a no-op since they don't derive `Validate`**
  - File: `src/models.rs`
  - Problem: Fields are UUIDs (type-enforced by serde), so low risk, but inconsistent with other models.
  - Fix: Add `Validate` derive or remove the `validate()` call in the handlers.
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`

## Informational Items

### Documentation — Test Count Maintenance Burden

- [ ] **#54 — Test counts in CLAUDE.md will drift as tests are added**
  - File: `CLAUDE.md`
  - Problem: Hard-coded test counts go stale every time tests are added or removed. Proven again by findings #83 (prior assessment) and #91 (this assessment).
  - Source command: `practices-audit`
  - Action: Inherent maintenance cost. The assessment process updates counts each time it runs.

### API Design — No Pagination on List Endpoints

- [ ] **#61 — List endpoints return all records without pagination**
  - Files: `src/db/` (all `get_*` list functions), `src/handlers/` (corresponding GET collection handlers)
  - Problem: All collection endpoints return all rows. Works at current scale but would degrade with growth.
  - Source commands: `review`, `api-completeness`
  - Action: Add `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` when data growth warrants it.

### Deployment — No `.env.example` File for Onboarding

- [ ] **#76 — No `.env.example` or env documentation for new developers**
  - Problem: New developers must read multiple files to discover available environment variables.
  - Source commands: `practices-audit`
  - Action: Create `.env.example` listing available env vars.

### API — `memberof.joined` Timestamp Not Exposed

- [ ] **#115 — `joined` column stored in DB but not returned by API**
  - Files: `src/models.rs` (`UsersInTeam`, `UserInTeams`), `src/db/teams.rs`
  - Problem: `memberof.joined` timestamp is stored but neither model struct includes it, and DB queries don't select it.
  - Source commands: `api-completeness`
  - Action: Add to models and queries if frontend needs it.

### Frontend — Consumes Only 4 of 41 Endpoints

- [ ] **#116 — Frontend only uses auth (3) + user-detail (1) endpoints**
  - File: `frontend/src/app.rs`
  - Problem: 37 backend endpoints are fully implemented but await frontend page development.
  - Source commands: `api-completeness`
  - Action: Documented in CLAUDE.md Frontend Roadmap. Will be consumed as pages are built.

### API Design — GET Endpoints Have No Team-Scoped RBAC

- [ ] **#117 — Any authenticated user can read any team's data**
  - Files: `src/handlers/teams.rs`, `src/handlers/orders.rs`, `src/handlers/users.rs`
  - Problem: All GET endpoints only require JWT authentication, not team membership. Deliberate design choice.
  - Source commands: `api-completeness`, `security-audit`
  - Action: Document as intentional. Reconsider if multi-tenant isolation is needed.

### Deployment — Dev Config in Production Docker Image

- [ ] **#118 — `development.yml` copied into production image unnecessarily**
  - File: `Dockerfile.breakfast` line 78
  - Problem: Dev config with localhost DB strings is included in production image.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`
  - Action: Only copy `default.yml` and `production.yml`.

### Security — Rate Limiter Uses IP-Based Key Extraction

- [ ] **#119 — Behind a reverse proxy, all requests share one IP**
  - File: `src/routes.rs` lines 20–24
  - Problem: `actix-governor` defaults to `PeerIpKeyExtractor`. Behind a proxy, rate limiting is ineffective.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`
  - Action: Use `SmartIpKeyExtractor` or configure `X-Forwarded-For` reading in production.

### Security — Auth Cache Staleness Window

- [ ] **#120 — 5-minute cache TTL allows stale credentials after password change**
  - File: `src/middleware/auth.rs` lines 328–336
  - Problem: After a password change, the old password continues to work for up to 5 minutes via cache.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`
  - Action: Reduce TTL to 60s or implement cross-instance cache invalidation.

### Dependencies — `native-tls` Compiled Alongside `rustls`

- [ ] **#121 — `refinery` unconditionally enables `postgres-native-tls`**
  - Problem: Adds `native-tls` and platform TLS libraries to a project that uses `rustls` exclusively. No mitigation without upstream feature gate.
  - Source commands: `dependency-check`
  - Action: Accept compile-time cost. File upstream issue on `refinery` if desired.

### Dependencies — Low-Activity `tracing-bunyan-formatter`

- [ ] **#123 — `tracing-bunyan-formatter` has infrequent releases**
  - Problem: Last published May 2024. Still usable but not frequently updated.
  - Source commands: `dependency-check`
  - Action: No action needed. Have `tracing-subscriber`'s built-in JSON formatter as fallback.

### Testing — Additional Coverage Gaps

- [ ] **#124 — Several test areas lack coverage: rate limiting, malformed JSON, FK cascade, `fix_migration_history`**
  - Problem: No tests for rate limiter behavior, malformed JSON body handling, FK cascade/constraint behavior on delete, or `fix_migration_history` DB interaction.
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add tests incrementally as high-risk code is modified.

### Frontend — `Page::Dashboard` Clones Data on Every Signal Read

- [ ] **#126 — Dashboard state stored in enum variant, cloned on every re-render**
  - File: `frontend/src/app.rs`
  - Problem: `Page::Dashboard { name: String, email: String }` — every `page.get()` clones both strings.
  - Source commands: `review`
  - Action: Store dashboard state in a separate signal when the dashboard grows.

### Frontend — Missing `aria-busy` on Submit Button

- [ ] **#127 — No `aria-busy` attribute during login form submission**
  - File: `frontend/src/app.rs`
  - Problem: Button is disabled and text changes to "Signing in..." but no `aria-busy="true"` informs assistive technology.
  - Source commands: `review`
  - Action: Add `attr:aria-busy=move || loading.get()`.

### Frontend — Decorative Icons Lack Accessibility Attributes

- [ ] **#128 — Warning icon and checkmark lack `aria-hidden="true"`**
  - File: `frontend/src/app.rs` (ErrorAlert and SuccessBadge components)
  - Problem: Screen readers will announce raw Unicode character names. Adjacent text already conveys meaning.
  - Source commands: `review`
  - Action: Add `aria-hidden="true"` to the icon `<span>` elements.

### Code Quality — Missing Doc Comments on DB Functions

- [ ] **#129 — Public functions in `src/db/` lack doc comments**
  - Files: `src/db/users.rs`, `src/db/teams.rs`, `src/db/roles.rs`, `src/db/items.rs`, `src/db/orders.rs`, `src/db/order_items.rs`
  - Problem: Functions like `is_team_order_closed`, `get_member_role`, `is_team_admin_of_user` have nuanced behavior that warrants documentation.
  - Source commands: `review`
  - Action: Add doc comments incrementally when modifying these files.

### Testing — `validate_optional_password` Has No Unit Tests

- [ ] **#172 — Custom validator for `UpdateUserRequest.password` has zero test coverage**
  - File: `src/models.rs` (`validate_optional_password`)
  - Problem: If this validator silently passes short passwords, users could set weak passwords via PUT. The function uses a non-standard `&String` signature required by the `validator` crate.
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add tests for `Some("short")` → error, `Some("validpass")` → pass, `None` → skip.

### Testing — No API Test for `user_teams` Endpoint

- [ ] **#173 — `GET /api/v1.0/users/{user_id}/teams` has no API-level integration test**
  - Files: `tests/api_tests.rs`, `src/handlers/users.rs`
  - Problem: Tested at DB level but no API test verifies JSON shape, JWT requirement, or empty-array behavior.
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add `get_user_teams_returns_empty_array`, `get_user_teams_returns_memberships`, `get_user_teams_requires_jwt`.

### Testing — `check_team_access` Combined RBAC Query Has No Direct Test

- [ ] **#174 — Core RBAC query tested only indirectly through API-level tests**
  - File: `src/db/membership.rs` (`check_team_access`)
  - Problem: Returns `(is_admin, team_role)` tuple via correlated subquery + EXISTS. A subtle SQL bug could be masked.
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add 4 direct DB tests: admin in team, member, non-member, admin not in team.

### Testing — No Test for Malformed Path Parameters

- [ ] **#175 — `GET /api/v1.0/users/not-a-uuid` → 400 path is untested**
  - Files: `tests/api_tests.rs`, `src/errors.rs` (`path_error_handler`)
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add `get_user_with_invalid_uuid_returns_400`.

### Testing — No Test for JSON Error Handler

- [ ] **#176 — Oversized/malformed JSON body error paths are untested**
  - Files: `tests/api_tests.rs`, `src/errors.rs` (`json_error_handler`)
  - Problem: Three sub-cases: ContentType → 415, deserialization → 422, other → 400. None tested.
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add `create_user_with_wrong_content_type_returns_415`, `create_user_with_invalid_json_returns_400`.

### Testing — No API Tests for `update_team` and `update_role` Success Paths

- [ ] **#177 — Admin happy path untested; only rejection path (`non_admin_cannot_*`) exists**
  - File: `tests/api_tests.rs`
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add `update_team_as_admin_returns_200`, `update_role_as_admin_returns_200`.

### Testing — No Tests for `Location` Header in Create Responses

- [ ] **#178 — All create handlers build `Location` header via `url_for` but no test verifies it**
  - Files: `tests/api_tests.rs`, `src/handlers/` (all create handlers)
  - Problem: If the named route string drifts, `url_for` silently fails (wrapped in `if let Ok`).
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add `create_user_sets_location_header`.

### Testing — No Rate Limiting Behavior Test

- [ ] **#179 — No test verifies the 11th rapid auth request returns 429**
  - Files: `tests/api_tests.rs`, `src/routes.rs` (governor config)
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add `auth_endpoint_rate_limits_after_burst`.

### Testing — No Validation Tests for Order-Related Models

- [ ] **#180 — `CreateOrderEntry`, `UpdateOrderEntry`, `CreateTeamOrderEntry`, `UpdateTeamOrderEntry` derive `Validate` but have no tests**
  - File: `src/models.rs`
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add basic validation tests to catch regressions if rules are added.

### Testing — No Test for Error Response Body Shape

- [ ] **#181 — Tests verify status codes but never assert response body matches `{"error": "..."}`**
  - File: `src/errors.rs`
  - Problem: A serialization change could break API clients.
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`
  - Action: Add `error_response_body_is_json_with_error_field`.

### Code Quality — `UpdateUserEntry` Serves Dual Purpose

- [ ] **#183 — Struct used for both auth cache and DB row mapping**
  - File: `src/models.rs`
  - Problem: Includes `password` hash (needed for cache verification) and derives `Validate` with password min-length rules (applies to plaintext, not hash).
  - Source commands: `review`
  - Action: Consider a dedicated `CachedUserData` type for the auth cache.

### Frontend — `authed_get` Only Supports GET

- [ ] **#184 — Future pages need `authed_post`, `authed_put`, `authed_delete` variants**
  - File: `frontend/src/app.rs`
  - Source commands: `review`
  - Action: Build generic `authed_request(method, url, body?)` when implementing the next frontend page.

### Deployment — Healthcheck Binary Hardcodes Port 8080

- [ ] **#185 — `let port = 8080;` is hardcoded in the healthcheck binary**
  - File: `src/bin/healthcheck.rs`
  - Problem: Production with a different port would cause healthcheck failures.
  - Source commands: `review`
  - Action: Read port from environment or config.
