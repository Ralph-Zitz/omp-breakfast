# Assessment Findings

Last assessed: 2026-03-08

This file is **generated and maintained by the project assessment process** defined in `CLAUDE.md` § "Project Assessment". Each time `assess the project` is run, findings of all severities (critical, important, minor, and informational) are written here. The `/resume-assessment` command reads this file in future sessions to continue work.

**Do not edit manually** unless you are checking off a completed item. The assessment process will move completed items to `.claude/resolved-findings.md`, update open items (file/line references may shift), remove items no longer surfaced, and append new findings.

## How to use

- Run `/resume-assessment` in a new session to pick up where you left off
- Or say: "Read `.claude/assessment-findings.md` and help me work through the remaining open items."
- Check off items as they are completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`

## Critical Items

_No open critical items._

## Important Items

_No open important items._

## Minor Items

_No open minor items._

## Informational Items

### Frontend — Uses `String` for UUIDs Everywhere

- [ ] **#321 — No type safety for UUID fields in frontend API types**
  - File: `frontend/src/api.rs`
  - Problem: All ID fields are `String`. A typo or wrong field could silently produce invalid requests.
  - Source commands: `review`

### Database — `orders.orders_team_id` May Be Missing NOT NULL

- [ ] **#325 — Advisory: verify that `orders_team_id` FK column has NOT NULL**
  - Files: `migrations/V1__initial_schema.sql`, `src/models.rs`
  - Source commands: `db-review`

### Security — Account Lockout State In-Memory Only

- [ ] **#339 — Login attempt tracking stored in `DashMap`, not shared across instances**
  - File: `src/middleware/auth.rs` (lines ~189–213)
  - Problem: In multi-instance deployment, attacker can distribute brute-force attempts across instances.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`

### Testing — `basic_validator` Malformed Password Hash Path Untested

- [ ] **#350 — When DB stores a corrupted/non-Argon2 hash, `PasswordHash::new()` fails and returns 500 — no test**
  - File: `src/middleware/auth.rs` (lines ~484–498)
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`

### API Completeness — Frontend `ItemEntry.price` Typed as `String`

- [ ] **#366 — Frontend `ItemEntry` uses `pub price: String` instead of a numeric type**
  - File: `frontend/src/api.rs`
  - Problem: Backend returns `numeric(10,2)` as a JSON number; frontend deserializes as `String` which works but loses type safety for display and arithmetic.
  - Source commands: `api-completeness`

### Database — `idx_teamorders_id_due` Index Unused by Any Query

- [ ] **#374 — Covering index on `(orders_team_id, due)` is never used; all order queries filter by `team_id` alone or by primary key**
  - File: `migrations/V6__order_constraint_and_index.sql`
  - Source commands: `db-review`

### Code Quality — Identical Create/Update Model Pairs in `models.rs`

- [ ] **#375 — `CreateTeamEntry`/`UpdateTeamEntry`, `CreateRoleEntry`/`UpdateRoleEntry`, `CreateItemEntry`/`UpdateItemEntry` have identical fields**
  - File: `src/models.rs`
  - Problem: 3 pairs of structs are field-identical. Could be unified or type-aliased to reduce boilerplate.
  - Source commands: `review`

### Security — JWT Validator Performs DB Lookup on Every Request

- [ ] **#381 — `jwt_validator` calls `db::get_user_by_email` on every authenticated request after cache miss**
  - File: `src/middleware/auth.rs`
  - Problem: Informational. The auth cache mitigates this for warm paths. Cold requests hit the DB. Not a bug, just a performance observation.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`

### Security — No Rate Limiting on Password Change Endpoint

- [ ] **#382 — `PUT /api/v1.0/users/{id}` has no rate limiter for password changes**
  - File: `src/routes.rs`
  - Problem: An attacker with a valid session could brute-force test many passwords via the update endpoint. Low risk because the endpoint requires authentication.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`

### Security — `delete_user_by_email` Email Existence Oracle

- [ ] **#383 — DELETE endpoint returns 404 vs 204, revealing whether an email exists in the system**
  - File: `src/handlers/users.rs`
  - Problem: Low risk — endpoint is admin-gated. But the response difference is observable.
  - Source commands: `security-audit`

### Testing — `auth_user` Cache Miss Path Untested

- [ ] **#389 — No test verifies the code path when the auth cache has no entry for a user (first login or after TTL expiry)**
  - File: `src/middleware/auth.rs`
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`

### Testing — Health Endpoint 503 Response Never Tested

- [ ] **#394 — No integration test verifies that `/health` returns HTTP 503 when the database is unreachable**
  - File: `tests/api_tests.rs`
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`

### Testing — `refresh_token` `DateTime::from_timestamp` Fallback Untested

- [ ] **#395 — The `DateTime::from_timestamp(exp, 0).unwrap_or_default()` fallback in `refresh_token` handler is never tested**
  - File: `src/handlers/users.rs`
  - Source commands: `test-gaps`

### Database — `SET timezone` in V1 Is Session-Scoped Dead Code

- [ ] **#438 — `SET timezone = 'Europe/Copenhagen'` only affects the migration connection session, not application connections**
  - File: `migrations/V1__initial_schema.sql` (line ~10)
  - Source commands: `db-review`

### Database — Seed Data `teamorders` INSERT Not Idempotent

- [ ] **#439 — `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` never fires because PK is auto-generated UUID; re-running seed creates duplicates**
  - File: `database_seed.sql` (lines ~178–187)
  - Source commands: `db-review`

### Database — FK Constraint Violations Return Generic 409 Message

- [ ] **#440 — All foreign key violations (23503) map to same opaque message regardless of which relationship is violated**
  - File: `src/errors.rs` (lines ~110–114)
  - Fix: Extract constraint name from DB error for more specific messages.
  - Source commands: `db-review`

### Database — No DB-Level Aggregate Query for Order Totals

- [ ] **#441 — No `get_order_total()` function; frontend must fetch all items and compute totals client-side**
  - File: `src/db/order_items.rs` (absent function)
  - Source commands: `db-review`

### Dependencies — `rustls` `tls12` Feature May Be Unnecessary

- [ ] **#442 — Internal app could enforce TLS 1.3 only by removing `tls12` feature**
  - File: `Cargo.toml` (rustls dependency)
  - Source commands: `dependency-check`

### Dependencies — Three Versions of `getrandom` Compiled

- [ ] **#443 — `getrandom` v0.2, v0.3, and v0.4 all compiled due to ecosystem version split**
  - File: `Cargo.toml` (transitive)
  - Source commands: `dependency-check`

### Dependencies — `refinery` Pulls `toml` 0.8 Alongside `config`'s 0.9

- [ ] **#444 — Duplicates the TOML parser; will resolve when `refinery` upgrades upstream**
  - File: `Cargo.toml` (transitive)
  - Source commands: `dependency-check`

### Dependencies — `opentelemetry-stdout` Used Unconditionally

- [ ] **#445 — Trace spans go to stdout in both dev and production; may conflict with Bunyan JSON logging in prod**
  - File: `Cargo.toml`, `src/server.rs` (line ~13)
  - Source commands: `dependency-check`

### Security — JWT HS256 With No Key Rotation Mechanism

- [ ] **#447 — No `kid` claim or multi-key support; compromised secret requires full restart**
  - File: `src/middleware/auth.rs` (lines ~65–70)
  - Source commands: `security-audit`

### Code Quality — Auth Cache Eviction O(n)

- [ ] **#453 — `evict_oldest_if_full` iterates all 1000 entries to find oldest; fine at current scale**
  - File: `src/middleware/auth.rs`
  - Source commands: `review`

### API Completeness — `OrderItemEntry` vs Backend `OrderEntry` Naming Inconsistency

- [ ] **#457 — Frontend renames the struct for clarity but creates naming mismatch with backend**
  - File: `frontend/src/api.rs` (lines ~96–104)
  - Source commands: `api-completeness`

### API Completeness — Bulk Team Order Delete Endpoint Not Consumed

- [ ] **#458 — `DELETE /api/v1.0/teams/{team_id}/orders` exists but has no frontend UI trigger**
  - File: `src/routes.rs`
  - Source commands: `api-completeness`

### API Completeness — Delete-User-by-Email Endpoint Not Consumed

- [ ] **#459 — AdminPage deletes by user_id only; the by-email endpoint is unreachable from UI**
  - File: `src/routes.rs`
  - Source commands: `api-completeness`

### API Completeness — Single-Resource GET Endpoints Not Consumed (×5)

- [ ] **#460 — Frontend always fetches via list endpoints; `GET /teams/{id}`, `GET /items/{id}`, `GET /roles/{id}`, single order, single order item all unused**
  - File: `src/routes.rs`
  - Source commands: `api-completeness`

### Database — `items.price` CHECK Constraint Allows Zero

- [ ] **#519 — `items.price CHECK (price >= 0)` permits items with zero cost; a breakfast ordering system likely doesn't intend free items**
  - File: `migrations/V1__initial_schema.sql`
  - Problem: No business-level protection against inserting cost-free items; the `validate_non_negative_price` custom validator also accepts zero.
  - Source commands: `db-review`

### Frontend — No Client-Side Validation for Item Price Format

- [ ] **#520 — Frontend items page accepts free-form text for price without validating it's a valid decimal number**
  - File: `frontend/src/pages/items.rs`
  - Problem: Backend validates, but poor UX if user enters non-numeric text — they get a generic server error instead of inline form feedback.
  - Source commands: `api-completeness`

## Completed Items

Resolved items are maintained in [`.claude/resolved-findings.md`](.claude/resolved-findings.md), organized by original severity.
See that file for the full history of resolved findings.

## Notes

- **Test counts verified (2026-03-06):** 234 unit (212 lib + 22 healthcheck), 145 API integration (ignored), 104 DB integration (ignored), 79 WASM.
- **`cargo audit` (2026-03-06):** Exit code 0. No vulnerabilities. RUSTSEC-2023-0071 resolved — `jsonwebtoken` replaced with `jwt-compact 0.8.0`, `--ignore` flag removed from Makefile.
- **CONNECT Design System (2026-03-06):** `git pull` fetched new commits (3.0.0-RC1, 2.9.0, etc.). CSS changes to checkbox-group, dropdown, inline-alert, menu, radio-group, tag, text-field, utility-button — **none used by our frontend**. Token additions (opacity variants) are non-breaking. SCSS removal has no impact (we only use CSS imports). **No migration required.**
- Open items summary: 0 critical, 0 important, 0 minor, 12 informational.
- 8 new findings in this assessment: #513–#520. 0 regressions found. 4 items resolved this session (#513, #514, #515, #516). 26 test-gap items resolved in session of 2026-03-07. 10 security-audit items resolved in session of 2026-03-08 (#336, #337, #338, #340, #379, #380, #448, #449, #450, #451).
